Nytro is a project scaffold that aims to make you more productive when starting new projects. It features sane out-of-the-box configuration. This demo uses a basic version of Nytro.

## Getting Started

Nytro uses `pnpm` by default, which is an incredibly fast alternative to `npm` for installing packages. It's not required, but we highly recommend you give it a try. You can download the latest version here: https://pnpm.io/

First you need to install the required dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

You should then be able to start the dev process. This will start up your Next.js server.

```bash
pnpm dev
```

The site should now be available on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)!
